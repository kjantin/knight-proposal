We have partnered with numerous organisations to convene the Responsible Data Forum (RDF) - a series of collaborative events aimed at identifying and producing practical responses to responsible data challenges. We have convened 8 events, in 5 countries, with 223 participants from more than 101 organisations. Through these events we have developed 17 tools that are now publicly available for use. Weâ€™ve built up a collection of blog posts on responsible data issues, http://responsibledata.io/blog/.
