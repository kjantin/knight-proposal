Successful outcomes of this project include: an expanded and committed community of responsible data problem solvers; real-world change in practice in organizations that have adopted responsible data policies; accessible and engaging resources that clearly communicate complex responsible data issues and how to address them; and an increase in demand for responsible data support coming from outside our core community.
