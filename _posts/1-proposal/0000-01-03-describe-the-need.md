Let’s say you are an advocacy organization that has been collecting data in paper form from your community for years. You want to move to a digital way of doing this, but you aren’t sure how to choose the right tools and processes - nor are you aware of what the responsible data concerns might be. We want to help you to make strong, well-informed and community-centered decisions about the way you work with technology & data.
